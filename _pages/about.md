<b>Currently,</b> I'm a Biomedical Data Science PhD student at <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/bmi.html">Stanford University</a> where I'm grateful to be advised by <a href="https://ai.stanford.edu/~syyeung/">Serena Yeung</a> in the <a href="https://marvl.stanford.edu/">MARVL</a> lab. My research interests lie at the intersection of AI and healthcare, centered in computer vision models for surgical skill assessment, training, and feedback. I'm also more generally interested in video understanding and multimodal foundation models in biomedicine. I've also interned in Hoifung's group @<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-health-futures/">Microsoft Research</a>.


<b>Previously,</b> I received my Bachelor's in Mathematics, Computer Science, and Physics at the <a href="https://ritchieschool.du.edu/academics-education/departments/computer-science">University of Denver</a> with a Distinction in Computer Science.
