<b>Currently,</b> I am a Biomedical Informatics PhD student at <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/bmi.html">Stanford University</a> advised by Prof. <a href="https://ai.stanford.edu/~syyeung/">Serena Yeung</a> in the <a href="https://marvl.stanford.edu/">MARVL</a> lab. My research interests are at the intersection of machine learning and healthcare, focusing on computer vision for surgical skill assessment and training. I'm also interested in active learning for mitigating data paucity challenges in medical imaging. 

<b>Previously,</b> I received my Bachelor's in Mathematics, Computer Science, and Physics at the <a href="https://ritchieschool.du.edu/academics-education/departments/computer-science">University of Denver</a> â€˜20, with a Distinction in Computer Science.
